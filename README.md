# dynobot
A bot written in Python. Just a project of mine.

# STUFF YOU'LL NEED
If, for whatever reason, you want to run this bot yourself, you'll need the following:
* Python 3. If you're on Windows, you'll need to install this.
https://www.python.org/
* Discord.py. This is necessary for it to run.
https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py
* FFMPEG. Not necessary for it to run but you'll need it if you want to stream audio.
https://ffmpeg.org/
* youtube-dl

# HOW TO USE
Just run it with whatever interpreter you've got. I tried to write it in a way that once you've got it going, it should tell you everything you need to use it.
You will need to add your own token to authorise the bot.
